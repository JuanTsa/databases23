In case a copy of the book is not available, the user's request (reservation) is put on hold and is served upon the return of a copy

A reservation cannot be made if a book has not been returned on time or if the same user has already borrowed the title.

Users have the option to cancel any current reservations.

Reservations have a time frame of one week and are automatically canceled once it expires.

In addition to inputting the aforementioned information, all users of the application must have the ability to manage information, including a search mechanism and options for updating or deleting it (CRUD).
