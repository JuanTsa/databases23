==== EXTRA ====
===============
administrator: backup, restore

In case a copy of the book is not available, the user's request (reservation) is put on hold and is served upon the return of a copy

A reservation cannot be made if a book has not been returned on time or if the same user has already borrowed the title.

Users have the option to cancel any current reservations.

Reservations have a time frame of one week and are automatically canceled once it expires.
